# Minimalistic Thesis Template

The logo is Tohoku University. You can change to whatever you like.

This template uses the simple `book` class with some modifications at the title page.

There is no need for any customized `.cls` . Just load it up and starting writing (or importing) your `.tex` files.

Dedication, Acknowledgements, and ToC pages are numbered in romans.

Arabic numbering is used starting from the first page of Chapter 1.

The bib engine is the simple `natbib`.
